There are several versions of the ESP01 on the market. They differ in pinout and memory size.

If your dealer offers ESP-01 with a blue PCB - do not buy! These have only 512KB of flash ram which is too low for ESPEasy-2.x.

The newer ESP-01 with a black PCB have 1MB flash, they run issuefree with ESPEasy-2.x.
