Publish simple "get" http requests:

Select device generic http 

controller settings:

 locate controller: use host name
 host name: maker.ifttt.com
 controller publish: trigger/switchpressed/with/key/secretkey

 In device setting, I just setup up a simple switch which trigger the controller to on state change to send the http request.

 notes: the "publish" field, leave out the "/", i.e just:
 " trigger/switchpressed/with/key/secretkey" and not "/trigger/switchpressed/with/key/secretkey".

Also note to leave out the "https://" in the host name field

espeasy seems to handle https easily without any cert declarations etc.
